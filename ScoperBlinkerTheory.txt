WORKING THEORY FOR WHAT's GOING ON WITH THE SCOPER AND THE BLINKER EXAMPLE!!!!!!
Somehow, solver_implies_condition for blinker is FALSE....



Or(And(passenger-in-taxi(p0,t0),
       taxi-blinker(t0),
       Not(Or(And(WALL_X(w0) == passenger-x-curr(p0) + 1,
                  WALL_Y(w0) == passenger-y-curr(p0) + 1)))))

^^ This condition appears for the move_north with blinker on action, and that's why the
blinker is made relevant!!!!!
