~~Notes on dealing with ungrounded actions and attributes~~
We currently ground all attributes and actions, ex. if there is a parameterized action pickup(?x), we create a separate
grounded pickup action for each possible ?x.
We do this because it is easier to implement, but we would prefer to leave object references ungrounded unless they must be grounded.
Groundings would start based on the objects mentioned in the goal condition, and propagate from there.
Similarly, we currently ground forall and exists statements via And and Or respectively. We would rather deal with the
quantifiers in a more elegant way. Dealing with parameterized actions/attributes and quantifiers more intelligently
would probably save computation.
