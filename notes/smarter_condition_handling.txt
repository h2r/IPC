We store toplevel Ands as AndLists and treat the components as separate conditions in the scoper
We are Trying to replace every Or that includes a condition true based on constants with True. It works for button_special_button.rddl, but not taxi.
    We currently don't set default constant values. This is an issue.

We want to store Ands as AndLists so we can check guarantees of each component separately
We want to simplify Or's based on conditions
I think we want to simplify Ands based on conditions. How does this interact with AndLists? As it stands, and2 doesn't make sense

~~Converting to CNF~~
Tactics take in a goal ( set of formulas) and outputs either sat, unsat, a sequence of subgoals (what does that mean?), or fails
	ctx-simplify (or regular simplify)
	tseitin-cnf (converts to cnf, but may introduce extra variables to avoid )
