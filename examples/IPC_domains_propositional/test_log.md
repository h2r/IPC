# List of Domains we've looked into for Scoping with FD
## Failures
- Spider (conditional effects)

## Could work, but not immediately obvious how
- Depot (the transition dynamics allow the agent to drive from one place to another easily, so hard to exploit this to introduce conditional irrelevance)

## Working
- Logistics (on prob15, Scoped FD currently outperforms FD even with the LM-Cut heuristic!)
