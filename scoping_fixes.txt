1. Find not implied conditions from the goal
2. Add these to relevant set. Quotient based on this set.
3. Find the preconditions of all the skills that have any effects
see which of them is implied and add to guarantees and discovered accordingly
(as we're currently doing)
4. run check_guarantees on this list of guarantees and the concrete skills [technically
we only need to run on the trivially relevant skills]
5. rerun the quotient and keep looping till set of relevant variales doesn't change.
